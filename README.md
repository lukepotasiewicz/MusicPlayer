# MusicPlayer
Android music player app

## Instructions to use:

In order to have this music player work, you must put .mp3 files in the "/sdcard/Music" folder.
It helps if these files have metadata and album art. In the repo is a folder named "music_files". Take these files and add them into the emulators music folder on the sd card.

In the repo there is a image named "Music Files Placement Example.png" that has an example of music files correctly placed in the sd card of the emulator via the Device file explorer.

For best results, use the Pixel 2 Emulator with API 28.
